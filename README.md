# 📖 [Awesome_Books] <a name="Awesome Books"></a>


**[Awesome_Books]** is a simple website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove books from that list. By building this application, you will learn how to manage data using JavaScript. Thanks to that, your website will be more interactive. You will also use a medium-fidelity wireframe to build the UI.

## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

- **[Question_1]**
What is a medium-fidelity wireframe?

  - Medium-fidelity wireframes present how your website's elements should be arranged, but they skip detailed information about aesthetics (e.g., colors, images). They can assist with communicating to teams how aesthetic features can support essential functionalities. Please read <a href="https://mentormate.com/blog/low-fidelity-wireframes-vs-high-fidelity-wireframes/" >Low Fidelity Wireframes vs High Fidelity Wireframes </a> to fully understand the difference between low-, medium-, and high-fidelity wireframes.

- **[Question_2]**
Where can I download node JS for installation?

  - Node Js can be downloaded here- <ul>
    <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/"> Node JS </a></li>
  </ul>
